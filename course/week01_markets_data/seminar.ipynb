During crashes, few companies are added, so the bias grows slowly.

    "Over roughly 15 years, JNJ's adjustment factor drifted by 20-30% purely from dividends. If you trained a model on unadjusted prices, your model's version of JNJ's history would understate total returns by that entire amount. For a stock returning 8-10% annualized, a 2% annual dividend distortion is not a footnote — it's a quarter of the signal. Now let's measure the return-level damage across all five tickers."

A model that sees an 85% single-day loss will weight it heavily, learning a pattern that never happened. JNJ's profile is the opposite: no catastrophic days, but persistent small RMSE from daily dividend adjustments — death by a thousand cuts.\n",

    "Here's the insight the lecture didn't give you: **the difficulty of detecting a corporate action is inversely proportional to its frequency.** Splits are rare and dramatic — easy to flag, easy to fix. Dividends are frequent and tiny — nearly impossible to detect from price data alone, yet they compound into the *larger* cumulative distortion. JNJ's 20-30% drift dwarfs any single split error in aggregate impact. In production, you don't detect dividends — you use a vendor that handles them. The real skill is knowing *when* to use adjusted vs. unadjusted: level analysis (options pricing, dollar volume) needs unadjusted; return analysis needs adjusted. Using the wrong one is always silent and always expensive."
