    "\n",
    "You're two weeks into your role at a quantitative fund. Last week you built the data pipeline — downloading, cleaning, and storing multi-asset price data so that every researcher on the floor has a reliable starting point. It was plumbing, and plumbing matters. But today the head of research drops by your desk with something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We need a volatility analysis toolkit. Every new research project starts with characterizing the volatility of the assets we're trading — are they clustered? persistent? asymmetric? What's the best model for each? And I keep hearing about fractional differentiation for ML features — can you build something that finds the optimal *d* for any ticker?\" She pauses. \"This isn't a one-off analysis. It's a toolkit your researchers will use every time they onboard a new asset or strategy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That last sentence is the one that matters. A script that works once on SPY and breaks on everything else is not a toolkit — it's a demo. What you're building today needs to handle the full zoo of financial assets: high-volatility growth stocks where GARCH barely converges, bond ETFs where the leverage effect might not exist, commodity proxies with entirely different memory structures. The class you build in Deliverable 1 will be your workhorse for the rest of this course, so the engineering decisions you make here — how to handle convergence failures, which long-run vol formula to use for EGARCH vs. standard GARCH, how to cache results so you don't re-fit models unnecessarily — are not academic exercises. They're the kind of choices that separate a quant who ships code from one who writes notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four deliverables below take you from a single-asset analyzer to a full multi-asset volatility report, then into fractional differentiation (where you'll discover that integer differencing throws away far more memory than necessary), and finally to a proper out-of-sample forecast evaluation where you'll settle the question: does GARCH actually beat a naive rolling-window estimate? The answer is yes — but the *when* and *by how much* will surprise you."

    "2. **A multi-asset volatility comparison report** — Run your analyzer on 10 tickers spanning equities, ETFs, bonds, and commodities proxies.

    "3. **A fractional differentiation feature builder** — Build a function that finds the minimum fractional differentiation order *d* (to 0.05 precision) for stationarity, returning the optimal series and diagnostic metrics. Run on 10 tickers and quantify the memory gain over integer differencing.\n",

But beyond those universals, the heterogeneity is striking. EGARCH is selected for 6 of the 10 tickers (SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, JPM, XLE) — these are the assets where negative returns spike volatility more than positive returns of the same magnitude. Standard GARCH wins for TLT, GLD, and TSLA, meaning the leverage effect is either absent or too weak for the extra parameter to justify itself by BIC. And BA is the lone GJR-GARCH selection — its asymmetry structure is different enough from the EGARCH parameterization that GJR fits better.\n",

That 0.054 gap sounds small, but persistence controls half-life: at 0.937, a volatility shock decays to half its impact in about 10 days. At 0.991, it takes about 77 days. TSLA's volatility memory is nearly 8x longer than AAPL's. If you're sizing positions in both, using the same vol lookback window for both is a mistake.\n",

Optimal *d* ranges from about 0.15 (XLE, the most mean-reverting ticker in our universe) to 0.50 (MSFT, with the strongest trend persistence). All 10 tickers show substantial memory gain: the correlation between the fractionally differenced series and the original price level is dramatically higher than the near-zero correlation you get with standard returns (d=1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about what this means in practical ML terms. When you compute standard returns and feed them to a model, you've achieved stationarity but destroyed every trace of *where* the price has been. Your model knows that today's return was +0.3%, but it has no idea whether the stock is at an all-time high or recovering from a 50% drawdown — because that level information was annihilated by differencing. At optimal *d*, you get a stationary series (safe for ML training) that still retains strong correlation with the price level (rich features for the model).\n",
    "\n",
    "The variation in optimal *d* across tickers is itself informative. Low-*d* tickers like XLE have price series that are closer to stationary even before differencing — they mean-revert more strongly, so less differencing is needed. High-*d* tickers like MSFT have stronger trends, requiring more aggressive differencing to kill the unit root. If you were building a multi-asset ML model, using a single *d* for all assets would systematically over-difference some and under-difference others. This per-asset optimization is not a luxury — it's the minimum bar for responsible feature engineering.\n",

If GARCH can't beat this simple backward-looking average, the added complexity isn't worth it. Then break the out-of-sample period into high-vol and low-vol regimes to identify *when* GARCH's advantage is largest.\n",

MSE of variance is dominated by a handful of extreme observations and gives unstable rankings. Use QLIKE for decisions, MSE for context."

TLT and GLD select vanilla GARCH, proving that the leverage effect is equity-specific, not universal.\n",

    "- **Persistence varies more than you'd expect.** TSLA's persistence (0.991) implies a volatility half-life of ~77 days; AAPL's (0.937) implies ~10 days. Using the same lookback window for both assets is a systematic error that most risk systems commit by default.\n",

    "- **Long-run vol spans a 4x range.** SPY at ~15% annualized vs. TSLA at ~57% — in the same 10-stock universe. Any model assuming homogeneous volatility across its universe is mispricing risk for the majority of its holdings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kurtosis ranges from 3.5 to 18.1.** TLT's tails are barely fatter than Gaussian; BA's are extreme. That 5x spread means tail risk models calibrated to the average kurtosis are too conservative for bonds and too aggressive for BA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fractional differentiation preserves massive memory.** Optimal *d* ranges from 0.15 to 0.50, meaning integer differencing (d=1) discards 50-85% of the level information that fractional differencing preserves. All 10 tickers show memory gain exceeding 0.77 in correlation terms.\n",
