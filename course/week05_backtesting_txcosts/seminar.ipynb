Your backtest did not find a signal. Your backtest found noise that happened to look good on this dataset. Now prove otherwise.\"*\n\nEvery exercise in this seminar is designed to break a comforting illusion. You heard in the lecture that backtests lie in systematic, identifiable ways. Now you are going to catch those lies yourself --- in live code, on real predictions, with real numbers. By the end of these four exercises, you will have personally measured how much of your strategy's apparent alpha comes from bugs, how much from methodology choice, how much from transaction cost naivety, and how much from statistical cherry-picking. The numbers are not pretty. That is the point."

Your job: figure out which is which, armed with nothing but their in-sample and out-of-sample IC profiles.\n\nThis is not a toy exercise. In 2014, Deutsche Bank's Markets Research team documented look-ahead bias as the single most common source of backtest failure in systematic strategies, with return inflation of 20--50%+ annualized for bugs where the label leaks into the signal. The more subtle variant --- survivorship bias --- produces \"deceptively smooth equity curves with modest but consistent outperformance.\" The diagnostic tool is the IS/OOS IC ratio, and the fingerprints are different enough that you can identify the contamination type from the numbers alone.\n\n**Your task:**\n\n1. Compute the IS and OOS Spearman rank IC for each of three signals (A, B, C) described below.\n2. For each signal, compute the IS/OOS IC ratio.\n3. Diagnose: which signal has a look-ahead bug? Which has survivorship-like bias? Which is clean?\n4. Explain *why* the fingerprints differ --- what mechanism produces collapse vs. uniform inflation?\n\n**Signal definitions:**\n- **Signal A:** In-sample, the \"prediction\" is actually the realized return itself (the outcome used as the signal). Out-of-sample, the honest GBM prediction is deployed. This simulates a researcher who accidentally used the outcome as a predictor during development and only discovered the bug after going live.\n- **Signal B:** The NN model evaluated on a survivorship-biased universe --- only tickers that remained in the S&P 500 throughout the full sample period. Both IS and OOS use the same biased universe.\n- **Signal C:** An equal-weight ensemble of GBM and NN, honestly evaluated. No contamination.\n\n**IS period:** 2019-04 to 2021-12. **OOS period:** 2022-01 to 2024-11."

Without auditing the universe construction, you would never catch it from the IC profile alone. In production, a model validation team checks the universe definition *before* examining IC --- because survivorship bias is the contamination that does not show up in standard diagnostic plots. This is why real fund researchers follow checklists, not intuition.\n\nThe exercise you just ran is a simplified version of the pre-deployment checklist that model risk analysts at firms like Two Sigma and Citadel execute on every new strategy submission.

Standard walk-forward CV respects temporal order but ignores this label overlap. Purged k-fold removes the contaminated observations. The question is: how much does it matter in practice?\n\nHere is the claim you are testing: **on monthly data with 1-month forward-return labels, purging makes a negligible difference to IC estimates --- but it changes which model looks best in more than half of the folds.** The IC delta is near zero because the label window (1 month) equals the data frequency, compressing the contamination zone to a single observation per fold boundary. But even a 1-observation shift can flip the relative ranking of models that have nearly identical IC. You are about to measure both effects.\n\n**Your task:**\n\n1. Run 10-fold walk-forward CV (sklearn `TimeSeriesSplit` with `gap=1`) and purged k-fold CV on the GBM, NN, and Ridge models.\n2. Compute the mean IC for each model under each CV method.\n3. Measure the IC delta: walk-forward minus purged. Is it positive, negative, or zero?\n4. Count the \"rank flip\" folds: how many folds change which model appears best?"

   "source": "The right panel tells the story. Red cells indicate folds where the walk-forward ranking disagrees with the purged ranking. In 6 of 10 folds, the \"best\" model changes based solely on whether you used walk-forward or purged CV. When three models have similar IC (GBM at 0.020, NN at 0.021-0.027, Ridge near zero), even the smallest perturbation in fold boundaries can flip the winner. This is not a pathological result --- it is the normal state of affairs when your signal-to-noise ratio is low. The methodology is doing the selecting, not the signal.\n\nThe takeaway is nuanced. On monthly data with 1-month labels, purging does not change your IC estimates in a statistically meaningful way --- the delta of -0.0011 is noise. But it *does* change your model selection in the majority of folds. Production quant shops running daily alpha models with 5--20 day forward-return labels see material purging effects on IC itself (10--30% reductions). Our exercise shows the mechanism correctly but at a frequency where the IC-level effect is structurally minimized. The rank-flip effect, however, is universal across frequencies."

Now you are going to map the *entire* feasibility space: across a grid of cost assumptions and turnover reduction strategies, where exactly does this strategy survive, and where does it die?\n\nHere is the practical question: **can this strategy survive real transaction costs?** The answer depends on two variables: the cost environment (bid-ask spreads, which vary by market cap) and your execution skill (how much turnover you can eliminate by filtering low-conviction trades). The feasibility frontier --- the boundary where net Sharpe crosses below 0.5 --- tells you exactly what combination of cost and execution is needed for viability.\n\n**Your task:**\n\n1. Compute the net-of-cost Sharpe ratio across a 9x6 grid: half-spread from 2 to 30 bps, turnover reduction from 0% to 50%.\n2. Identify the feasibility frontier: where does net Sharpe = 0.5?\n3. Find the breakeven spread at 0% turnover reduction.\n4. Answer: is this strategy viable at large-cap cost levels (2-5 bps)? At mid-cap levels (12-25 bps)?"

   "source": "The green-to-red gradient is the visual representation of statistical significance being consumed by the search process. The bottom-right corner (few trials, long track records) is bright green. The top-left corner (many trials, short records) is deep red. The white dashed contour at DSR=0.50 is the go/no-go boundary. Everything above and to the left is \"your result could easily be noise.\" Everything below and to the right is \"your result has survived the statistical gauntlet.\"\n\nThe practical implication: when a fund allocator asks \"what's the track record?\" they are implicitly asking a DSR question. A 12-month track record with a Sharpe of 0.7 sounds decent. But if the researcher tried 20 variants before landing on this one, the DSR says the result is indistinguishable from noise. The track record length and the number of trials are inseparable --- you cannot evaluate one without the other. Honest DSR computation requires honest accounting of the search process. Most fund pitch books do not include this accounting. Now you know why."

   "source": "## What You Just Proved\n\nFour exercises, four illusions shattered. In Exercise 1, you measured the fingerprints of two common biases: the look-ahead bug that produces IC = 1.0 in-sample and 0.016 out-of-sample (a 64x collapse), and the survivorship bias that inflates both periods uniformly (IS/OOS ratio of just 1.8x). Different contamination types leave different diagnostic signatures, and the IS/OOS IC ratio is the first-pass detection tool.\n\nIn Exercise 2, you discovered that on monthly data with 1-month labels, purging changes the mean IC by exactly -0.0011 --- statistically indistinguishable from zero. But the same purging changes which model ranks best in 6 of 10 folds. The aggregate IC gap is negligible; the model selection impact is not. Methodology choice affects model selection even when it barely touches aggregate performance.\n\nIn Exercise 3, you mapped the full cost-viability space and found that the strategy is viable at large-cap spreads (2-5 bps) with 46 of 54 grid cells feasible, but breaks down at mid-cap levels (15+ bps without turnover reduction). The breakeven spread of 15 bps at 0% turnover reduction sits right at the boundary between large-cap and mid-cap territory --- the strategy's viability depends entirely on the composition of its universe.\n\nIn Exercise 4, you watched the DSR collapse from 1.000 (single strategy, 5-year record) to 0.045 (best of 50, 6-month record). At just 5 trials with a 2-year track record, the DSR already crosses below the 0.50 threshold. Non-normality (excess kurtosis of 4.23) inflates the minimum track record by roughly 17x compared to the Gaussian assumption. Most practitioners implicitly use Gaussian assumptions when evaluating track records. They are wrong by an order of magnitude.\n\nTogether, these results paint a coherent picture: a strategy that looks promising at gross Sharpe 0.87 loses a third of its quality to transaction costs, fails statistical significance under an honest accounting of the search process at short track records, and sits on a cost-viability boundary that depends on the market cap of the stocks it trades. The lecture said the gap between \"great backtest\" and \"live alpha\" is a precise set of corrections. You just measured each one.\n\n**Career connection:** The analysis you just completed is what a junior quant researcher at a multi-strategy hedge fund produces during their first week on the job. The IC diagnostic from Exercise 1 is the pre-deployment data integrity check. The CV comparison from Exercise 2 determines which model goes to paper trading. The feasibility frontier from Exercise 3 is what the execution desk uses to negotiate turnover budgets with the PM. The DSR surface from Exercise 4 is what goes into the strategy evaluation memo that the risk committee reviews before allocating capital. Every exercise maps to a real deliverable at a real desk.\n\n**What comes next in the homework:** You have probed each correction in isolation. The homework asks you to build the infrastructure that integrates them: a `PurgedKFold` class, a `TransactionCostModel`, and a three-layer responsible backtest report that combines all of the above into a single go/no-go verdict. You will discover that when purging, TC accounting, and DSR correction are applied simultaneously, the strategy's survival becomes a razor-thin question --- the kind of question that separates a paper strategy from a funded one."
