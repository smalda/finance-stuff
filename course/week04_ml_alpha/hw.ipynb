    "# Week 4: ML for Alpha — From Features to Signals\n",

    "> *\"Every month, a quant researcher lines up 3,000 stocks and asks one question: which ones will be in the top decile next month? That question — and the pipeline that answers it — is the economic engine behind most systematic equity funds. This week, you build the engine.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission: construct a complete, end-to-end cross-sectional alpha pipeline — the system that takes raw features, trains a model, evaluates signal quality, and converts predictions into portfolio returns. By the time you finish, you will have built a reusable class that mirrors the architecture behind production alpha research at firms like Two Sigma, AQR, and WorldQuant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a toy exercise. The `AlphaModelPipeline` you build in Deliverable 1 is the skeleton that Weeks 5 and 6 will extend with proper backtesting validation and portfolio optimization. Deliverable 2 tests whether you can improve the signal through feature engineering — and the answer may surprise you. Deliverable 3 asks the question every CIO at a quantitative fund eventually asks: \"Should we switch from gradient boosting to neural networks?\" Your job is to produce an honest answer backed by data, not by hype.\n",
    "\n",
    "A warning before you begin: the signal-to-noise ratio in cross-sectional equity prediction is catastrophically low. An information coefficient of 0.05 makes you a star. Your best ImageNet model gets 0.99. The metrics, the evaluation framework, and the definition of \"success\" are all different here. Recalibrate your expectations accordingly."

    "\n",
    "The lecture showed you how to train a LightGBM model, compute IC, and construct a long-short portfolio — one piece at a time, with fresh code in each section. That is how you learn the components. But nobody at a fund writes alpha research that way. In production, the entire pipeline — temporal splitting, walk-forward training, signal evaluation, portfolio construction — lives inside a single, reusable class. One call to `pipeline.run()` produces a full signal evaluation. A different model? Swap in Ridge, retrain, compare. A different feature set? Same pipeline, different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to build that class: `AlphaModelPipeline`. It must accept any scikit-learn-compatible model, run a walk-forward loop with a configurable purge gap, compute IC and rank IC at every OOS date, construct a long-short portfolio from model predictions, and return a summary dictionary with every metric a portfolio manager would want to see. This is the first artifact in the course that connects features to portfolio performance end-to-end — the skeleton that Weeks 5 and 6 will extend with combinatorial purged cross-validation and transaction cost-aware portfolio optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In production, this is where it breaks: the purge gap. If you get temporal integrity wrong — if even one training window overlaps with the prediction date — your entire IC estimate is contaminated. A fund running this pipeline on production data would have a second system that independently verifies no look-ahead leakage exists. You will build that verification step."

The ICIR of 0.305 tells you the signal-to-noise ratio: for every 1 unit of signal, there are roughly 3.3 units of noise. The gross Sharpe of approximately 0.98 looks attractive, but the turnover of 80% monthly means the portfolio replaces most of its holdings every month.

    "The left panel shows the decile monotonicity: a broadly upward slope from bottom to top decile, with the spread of about 0.88% per month between decile 10 and decile 1. The monotonicity rank correlation of 0.83 is strong for an ML-based signal. The right panel shows cumulative gross and net long-short returns — the gap between the two lines is the cost of trading, compounding over 68 months. At a fund, this chart is the first thing a PM looks at when evaluating a new signal.\n",

    "The Week 3 feature matrix has 7 features. Can you do better? GKX (2020) tested 94 characteristics and found that expanding the feature set improved OOS R-squared by roughly 50%. The implication seems clear: more features, more signal. But there is a catch — one that most ML engineers discover the hard way. The GKX result holds on 3,000 CRSP stocks with 94 well-chosen, point-in-time features. On 174 S&P 500 stocks with 18 features, several of which are correlated and two of which have look-ahead bias, the story may be quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission: expand the feature matrix from 7 to 15-25 features using domain-motivated additions. Include multi-horizon momentum, realized volatility, Amihud illiquidity (price-derived features that are point-in-time clean), plus new fundamental ratios and interaction terms. Then run the expanded features through the pipeline from Deliverable 1 and answer a precise question: did feature expansion improve IC?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where it gets interesting. The PIT contamination check at the end will reveal something counterintuitive about the relationship between data quality and signal strength. The fundamental features — which have full look-ahead bias — may not improve the signal at all, and may actually hurt it."

    "Here is the result that should make every ML engineer pause: adding 11 features to a 7-feature model on 174 S&P 500 stocks *degraded* the signal. The IC dropped from 0.055 to about 0.034 — a change of -0.020 (p = 0.13, not statistically significant, but the direction is clear). This is the opposite of the GKX (2020) production result, where expanding from 10 to 94 features improved R-squared by about 50%. What happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two factors drive the degradation. First, the 174-stock cross-section provides insufficient variation for 18 features to separate signal from noise — the model's search space grows (more features to split on) while the informational content of each cross-section stays fixed. Second, the near-multicollinearity between momentum_z and mom_12m_1m (correlation 0.923) forces the GBM to make arbitrary split choices between essentially duplicate features, injecting noise into the prediction rankings. On a 3,000-stock cross-section with 94 diverse features, each additional feature captures genuine new variation. On 174 large-cap stocks with 18 correlated features, the additions are mostly noise. This is why feature engineering in finance is a domain knowledge problem, not an automation problem — you need to know which features add genuine information at your specific scale.\n",

    "The horizontal bar chart reveals the importance hierarchy at a glance.

    "The error bars overlap — the IC degradation from feature expansion is not statistically significant (p = 0.13). But the direction is clear and consistent across multiple runs. At a fund, this chart would end the conversation about adding these features to the production model at this universe scale. You would file it under \"revisit when we have 3,000 stocks.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The core lesson from this deliverable: more features is not always better. Feature expansion that improves performance on a 3,000-stock, 94-feature universe can actively degrade performance on a 174-stock, 18-feature subset. The production result requires both a larger feature set and a larger cross-section to materialize. This is one of the most important lessons for ML engineers entering finance — the relationship between feature count and signal quality is not monotonic, and it depends critically on the scale of your data."

    "\n",
    "Your fund's CIO walks into your office and asks the question that defines a quant team's technology stack: \"Should we switch from gradient boosting to neural networks?\" This is not a casual question. Rewriting a production pipeline costs engineering months, introduces new failure modes (GPU infrastructure, training instability, hyperparameter sensitivity), and requires revalidating every downstream system. The CIO needs a rigorous, honest answer — not hype about \"deep learning\" and not reflexive conservatism about \"if it ain't broke.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to produce that answer. You will run four model families — OLS, Ridge, LightGBM, and a feedforward neural network — through the same pipeline on the same expanded feature set. You will evaluate on the metrics that actually matter (IC, ICIR, Sharpe, turnover, net Sharpe), compute pairwise statistical tests, apply the deflated Sharpe ratio for multiple testing, and write a structured recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The teaser: the model ranking on our data is the *inverse* of what GKX (2020) found on production data. That inversion — and the reason behind it — is the most important finding in this homework."

    "Each gap has a directional impact. The feature gap means our models are starved — 18 features versus the 94 that GKX used. The universe gap means our cross-section is too small for non-linear models to find the complex interactions they are designed to exploit. The PIT contamination means our fundamental features are unreliable. And the survivorship bias inflates all returns equally, making the absolute Sharpe numbers unreliable while leaving relative rankings approximately valid.\n",

    "The net Sharpe comparison at 10 bps one-way cost is the metric that matters for production viability. At institutional S&P 500 execution costs (5-15 bps per Frazzini, Israel & Moskowitz, 2018), the linear models' signals survive — but only barely. The NN's net Sharpe of approximately 0.20 is marginal at best. In production, the portfolio construction step (Week 6) would add turnover constraints that reduce costs but also reduce signal utilization — a trade-off that is the daily bread of portfolio management."

    "The three-panel chart tells the complete story at a glance. Panel A shows the IC error bars overlapping heavily — no model is statistically distinguishable from another. Panel B shows ICIR telling a similar story, though LightGBM and the linear models are tightly clustered while the NN falls behind. Panel C shows the economic bottom line: gross Sharpe is positive for all models, but the gap between gross and net bars — the cost of trading — is substantial. Ridge leads in both gross and net Sharpe, not because it is a \"better\" model, but because its linear predictions produce more stable portfolio rankings month to month, resulting in lower turnover."

    "## What You Built\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline you constructed over these three deliverables — `AlphaModelPipeline`, the feature expansion, and the model comparison — is a simplified version of what a quantitative researcher at a systematic fund operates every day. The core architecture is the same: walk-forward temporal splitting, signal evaluation via IC, portfolio construction via quantile sorts, and cost-adjusted performance measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The surprising findings tell a story about scale dependence. On our 174-stock, 18-feature sandbox, feature expansion degraded IC by 0.020 (baseline 0.055 vs. expanded 0.034), the model ranking inverted relative to published results (linear > GBM > NN), and no individual model produced a statistically significant signal on the expanded feature set. These results are not failures — they are the honest outcomes of running production-grade methodology at sandbox scale. The GKX (2020) result, where neural networks marginally outperform gradient boosting on 94 features and 3,000 stocks, requires exactly the scale our sandbox lacks. Understanding *when* complexity helps — and when it hurts — is the meta-lesson that separates a practitioner from a Kaggle competitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is still missing? Our pipeline uses a simple quantile sort for portfolio construction — Week 6 will replace this with mean-variance optimization and turnover constraints. Our backtesting has no combinatorial purged cross-validation — Week 5 will add that. Our transaction cost model is a flat per-trade assumption — production models use market-impact functions that scale with order size. And our fundamental features have full look-ahead bias — production systems use point-in-time databases like Compustat's Xpressfeed or Refinitiv's DataScope."

    "The `AlphaModelPipeline` you built is a pedagogically transparent version of what Microsoft Qlib and similar open-source frameworks provide for production alpha research. A quantitative researcher at a multi-manager pod shop like Millennium or Citadel owns a pipeline exactly like this — their performance is measured by net Sharpe after costs, which is literally the number your `summary()` method returns. The feature engineering process in Deliverable 2 is the daily work of the feature engineering team at a systematic fund, which often has more headcount than the modeling team. And the CIO recommendation in Deliverable 3 is the kind of memo that junior quants write when their team evaluates new technology — honest, data-driven, and specific about what would change the answer. The skills you exercised here — temporal integrity, domain-motivated feature engineering, honest model comparison — are the ones that get you past the first round of interviews."

    "You now have a cross-sectional alpha model that produces signals and constructs portfolios. But how do you know the results are real? Week 5 takes this pipeline and stress-tests it — purged cross-validation, combinatorial purged CV, the deflated Sharpe ratio (which you briefly touched in D3), and transaction cost modeling that goes far beyond our simple spread estimate. The question shifts from \"can I build a signal?\" to \"should I believe it?\""
