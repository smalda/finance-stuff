    "## Your Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "Your quant team lead just handed you a research note from Marcos Lopez de Prado and asked a pointed question: \"He claims there's a sweet spot between raw prices and returns — fractional differentiation. Is he right, or is this just academic marketing?\" You have one week to answer that question with data, not opinions. Fifty S&P 500 stocks, three competing feature representations, and a Ridge regression that does not care about anyone's reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what makes this more than a replication exercise. The lecture showed you FFD on a single stock and called it a day. The seminar tested 15 assets across asset classes. But when you scale to 50 equities spanning every sector of the US economy, something new emerges: the optimal differencing order $d^*$ is not a universal constant — it is a *fingerprint* of how each stock carries memory in its price history. Boring utilities with slow-moving cash flows need barely any differencing. Volatile tech stocks need aggressive treatment. The pattern is economically meaningful, and you could not have seen it without running the full cross-section.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also fit GARCH(1,1) to all 50 stocks — building the volatility baseline that your LSTM will compete against in Week 8. Three parameters, zero feature engineering, no GPU required. If your deep learning model cannot beat this, you need to ask yourself why you are paying the electricity bill. Finally, you will build a production-quality `FractionalDifferentiator` class that plugs into sklearn pipelines. This class follows you through the rest of the course — Weeks 4, 5, 8, and beyond. If it is wrong, everything downstream is wrong. If it is right, you have infrastructure that most quant teams spend months building.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing. You are going to discover that raw log prices ($d=0$) sometimes produce the *highest* R-squared in your regressions. This is a trap. The model is fitting the trend, not the signal, and it will blow up spectacularly the moment the trend reverses. Documenting *why* it is a trap is as important as building the features that avoid it."

Report a DataFrame with ticker, sector, $d^*$, ADF statistic, and ADF p-value. Visualize: histogram of $d^*$ and boxplot by sector.\n",

    "2. **Ridge regression with 3 feature sets.** For each stock, create three feature sets from 5 lags: (a) raw log returns only, (b) FFD($d^*$) features only, (c) FFD($d^*$) + returns + additional lagged features. Use walk-forward time-series cross-validation. Report out-of-sample R-squared across feature sets.\n",

    "4. **Fit GARCH(1,1) to all 50 stocks.** Extract omega, alpha, beta, persistence ($\\alpha + \\beta$), and unconditional volatility. Visualize: persistence distribution histogram, sector comparison boxplot. Identify highest- and lowest-persistence stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Build the `FractionalDifferentiator` class.** Production-quality, sklearn-compatible, built incrementally with monkey-patching. Methods: `__init__`, `_compute_weights`, `fit`, `transform`, `fit_transform`. Include unit tests and a usage demo on a sample stock."

The stocks where FFD provides the largest improvement over returns are those with *low* $d^*$ — stocks where there is a big gap between $d = 0$ (prices) and $d = 1$ (returns). For a stock that needs $d^* = 0.25$ for stationarity, standard returns are applying 4x more differencing than necessary. That excess differencing destroys information — specifically, the long-memory component that tells you the stock has been trending for months. FFD preserves that signal.\n",

    "For stocks where $d^* \\approx 0.9$ or higher, FFD is essentially doing the same thing as returns, so there is no improvement. This makes perfect sense: if the minimum effective dose is close to 1.0, the \"overdose\" from full differencing is negligible.\n",

    "Also notice the alpha-beta tradeoff. Most stocks have persistence between 0.95 and 0.99, but they allocate that budget differently. High-alpha stocks (like TSLA) react strongly to individual shocks — one bad day spikes their conditional variance — but the spike fades relatively quickly. High-beta stocks (like many mega-cap financials) react less to any single day but carry that elevated variance forward for longer. Both produce similar total persistence, but the *dynamics* feel different: TSLA's volatility is spiky and fast-decaying, while JPM's is smoother and more slowly evolving.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is what this homework revealed — not concepts restated from the lecture, but findings that only emerged from running 50 stocks through the full analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The optimal $d^*$ varies dramatically across stocks, and the pattern is economically meaningful.** Utilities and consumer staples need $d^*$ around 0.1-0.3; their prices are already close to stationary. Technology and consumer discretionary stocks need $d^*$ around 0.4-0.7; their aggressive trends require more differencing. This reflects fundamental differences in how these stocks carry memory in their price histories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fractionally differentiated features provide incremental value over standard returns, especially for stocks with low $d^*$.** When $d^*$ is far from 1.0, standard returns over-differentiate and destroy long-memory information. FFD preserves that signal. The improvement is modest but real — and in a universe of 50 stocks rebalanced monthly, modest improvements compound.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The combined feature set (FFD + returns + volatility) tends to outperform either representation alone.** This tells you that FFD, returns, and rolling volatility capture *complementary* information about the stock's recent dynamics. A model that uses all three sees a richer picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **GARCH(1,1) persistence is remarkably consistent within sectors and meaningfully different between them.** Financials tend to have the highest persistence — volatility shocks cascade through counterparties and regulators. Consumer staples and utilities forget faster. The alpha-beta decomposition reveals that high-volatility stocks (TSLA) react strongly but briefly to shocks, while large-cap names carry elevated variance forward for longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The `FractionalDifferentiator` class is production-ready infrastructure.** It finds $d^*$ per feature, applies FFD, and integrates with sklearn pipelines. You will use it for the rest of the course — not because FFD is always the best approach, but because it is a principled default that respects both stationarity and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bridge to Week 3:** Next week, we shift from individual stocks to portfolios. You will learn what \"alpha\" actually means, why the Sharpe ratio is the one metric everyone in finance cares about, and why the \"optimal\" portfolio from a textbook blows up the moment you use it with real data. The features you built this week — FFD-transformed prices, GARCH volatility estimates — will feed directly into the portfolio construction pipeline. The `FractionalDifferentiator` will handle the stationarity problem so you can focus on the harder question: which combinations of stocks make money?"
