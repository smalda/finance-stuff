## 4. ASSET CLASS FREQUENCY

| Asset Class | Frequency in Listings | Primary Firms |
|---|---|---|
| **Equities** | ~45% (most common) | Millennium, HRT, Balyasny, AQR, Man AHL, Citadel, Point72 |
| **Futures** | ~30% | IMC, Squarepoint, Jump Trading, Man AHL |
| **Options / Derivatives** | ~30% | Optiver, IMC, Akuna, SIG, Man AHL (volatility) |

## 6. SURPRISING AND NON-OBVIOUS FINDINGS

### Finding 1: Finance Knowledge is Explicitly NOT Required at Most Top Firms
This is perhaps the single most surprising finding for outsiders. The following firms explicitly state that no finance background is needed:
- **Jane Street:** "We don't expect you to have a background in finance or any other specific field"
- **Two Sigma:** "You don't need a background in finance...more than half of Two Sigma's employees come from outside the finance industry"
- **Renaissance Technologies:** Hires "mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists with no background in finance"
- **G-Research:** "No need for experience in finance"
- **D.E. Shaw:** Focuses on "top students in their respective math, statistics, physics, engineering, computer science" programs
- **Tower Research:** "Financial experience is not required"

**The implication:** Domain knowledge in finance is something firms expect to teach on the job. What they cannot teach is mathematical maturity, programming skill, and research methodology.

### Finding 2: OCaml at Jane Street is Real
Jane Street explicitly seeks candidates "interested in learning OCaml, even if you've never done functional programming before." They use OCaml as their primary production language. This is unique in the industry.

### Finding 3: GPU Infrastructure Scale is Staggering
- **Jane Street:** "Petabytes of data and GPU clusters (tens of thousands of high-end GPUs)"
- **XTX Markets:** "Over 25,000 GPUs with 650 petabytes of usable storage"
- **G-Research:** "Near infinite compute"

These firms are operating at a scale comparable to major tech companies in terms of compute infrastructure, which means experience with distributed computing and GPU programming is increasingly valuable.

### Finding 4: "Production-Quality Research Code" is a Growing Expectation
Multiple listings (Citadel Data Strategies, HRT, IMC, Millennium) explicitly require researchers to write production-quality code and/or productionalize their own ideas. The traditional wall between "researcher prototypes in Python" and "engineer rebuilds in C++" is dissolving. Researchers are increasingly expected to own the full pipeline from research to production.

### Finding 5: Kaggle and Competition Winners are Explicitly Valued
- **XTX Markets:** "Outstanding performance in any quantitative field or contest (Kaggle, hackathons, olympiads, academic contests etc)"
- **G-Research:** "Exceptional candidates with a proven record of success in online data science competitions, such as Kaggle"

This provides a concrete, actionable pathway for ML practitioners: demonstrable Kaggle performance is a credible signal to quant firms.

### Finding 6: Academic Engagement is Part of the Job
- **Two Sigma:** Researchers participate in "reading circles on latest research papers, attend academic seminars from thought leaders at top universities, and share insights from conferences"
- **Man AHL:** Works with the Oxford-Man Institute; engagement with academic research is expected
- **G-Research:** Researchers "attend top conferences" and engage with cutting-edge ML research

This means the job is not just about building models -- it involves staying at the research frontier.

### Finding 7: KDB/Q is a Hidden High-Value Skill
KDB (a specialized time-series database and its associated language Q) appears at Millennium (5+ years experience required) and Squarepoint. It is a niche skill but commands premium compensation and has far less competition than Python or C++.

### Finding 8: "Intellectual Curiosity" is Assessed, Not Just Mentioned
Firms like Jane Street, Bridgewater, and G-Research do not merely list "intellectual curiosity" as boilerplate. Their interview processes are specifically designed to assess it -- through open-ended problems, research presentations, and the ability to engage with unfamiliar domains.

### Finding 9: Execution/Market Microstructure is an Underappreciated Specialization
Several firms (HRT, Citadel Securities, Graham Capital, Millennium Execution Services) have dedicated roles for "execution quants" who focus on market microstructure, order book analysis, transaction cost analysis, and execution algorithms. This is a distinct sub-field that many ML practitioners might overlook but which has strong demand and less competition.

### Finding 10: Alternative Data is Now Mainstream
Citadel's Data Strategies Group works with "petabyte-scale alternative datasets ranging from high frequency sensor data to unstructured event data." This includes satellite imagery, credit card transaction data, geolocation data, web-scraped data, and social media sentiment. 85% of leading hedge funds use at least two alternative datasets, and nearly a third attribute over 20% of their performance to it.

### Finding 11: LLM/GenAI Roles are Emerging but Still Niche
Point72 has an explicit "NLP / AI Engineer" role focused on LLMs, and there are "Head of LLM Research" positions at hedge funds. However, these represent a small fraction (<10%) of overall quant hiring. The industry is experimenting with LLMs but hasn't fully industrialized them yet.

### Finding 12: The "Quant Trading Associate" Path Exists for Non-PhDs
Millennium's "Quant Trading Associate" program and similar programs at other firms offer entry points for strong quantitative candidates without PhDs, though the bar remains extremely high.

### Finding 13: Volatility as a Distinct Research Domain
Man AHL and Optiver have dedicated "Volatility Researcher" roles that combine options pricing expertise with quantitative research. This requires a blend of derivatives knowledge and statistical modeling that is relatively rare.

### Finding 14: Cross-functional Ability is Increasingly Valued
Multiple listings emphasize working "across departments," partnering with "traders, engineers, and researchers," and understanding how individual contributions fit into broader trading operations. Pure technical isolation is not rewarded.

## 8. SYNTHESIS: THE SKILL LANDSCAPE FOR ML/DL EXPERTS ENTERING QUANT FINANCE

### What You Already Have (if you're an ML/DL expert):
- Python proficiency
- Machine learning methodology
- Deep learning (architectures, training)
- Statistical analysis
- Research methodology
- PyTorch/TensorFlow

### What You Need to Add:
1. **Time-series analysis** -- financial data is fundamentally time-series; non-stationarity, regime changes, low signal-to-noise ratio are the norm
2. **Backtesting methodology** -- understanding overfitting in financial contexts, look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, transaction cost modeling
3. **Basic financial market knowledge** -- how markets work, what an order book is, how trades execute, bid-ask spreads, market-making
4. **Portfolio construction and risk management** -- how individual signals combine into portfolios, position sizing, risk controls
5. **C++ proficiency** (if targeting quant dev roles or HFT)
6. **SQL** (if targeting multi-strategy funds)
7. **Production code quality** -- writing code that can run in production, not just notebooks
8. **Understanding of overfitting** in the specific context of financial data (small effective sample sizes, regime changes, data snooping)

### Your Competitive Advantages as an ML/DL Expert:
1. Deep learning expertise is becoming table stakes but is still rare in practice
2. NLP/LLM experience is in extremely high demand with very few qualified candidates
3. Experience with large-scale compute (distributed training, GPU clusters) maps directly to firm infrastructure
4. Research methodology transfers directly

### Your Key Gaps (What Finance Has That ML Doesn't):
1. Signal-to-noise ratio in finance is orders of magnitude worse than in typical ML applications
2. Non-stationarity -- the patterns change because the market adapts
3. Transaction costs, slippage, and market impact -- the cost of being right too slowly
4. Regulatory and risk constraints that limit what you can actually trade
5. The adversarial nature of markets -- your counterparties are also smart
